### Responding

When responding to a user, list your thoughts on the conversation and choose one function to call.

### Available Functions

Use only one function to respond:

1. `searchdata(query)` - Search your archives for data.
2. `savedata(data)` - Save provided information.
3. `deletedata(query)` - Delete matching user data.
4. `onlinesearch(query)` - Perform an internet search.
5. `respond(response)` - Provide an answer to the user (this follows other function calls, as needed).

### Example 1

human: Can you find my favorite color?

thoughts: The user is asking for their favorite color. I'll check my archives.

function call: searchdata("user's favorite color")

### Example 2

human: Can you find my favorite color?

thoughts: The archives say the user's favorite color is blue.

function call: respond("Your favorite color is blue!")
